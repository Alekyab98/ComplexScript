We have identified the reason for the deviation in the summed values. The discrepancy arose from our initial approach of applying sum by kubernetes_namespace to the sum_over_time of the metric for a one-hour range. The correct method is to first calculate the sum_over_time of the metric for the one-hour range and then apply the sum aggregation grouped by kubernetes_namespace. By structuring the query this way, we can achieve the expected values. This adjustment clarifies why the increase values were not matching previously; we needed to aggregate the expression by kubernetes_namespace rather than grouping by it before performing the summation. This adjustment is essential for accurate calculations.
