Here’s a more professional way to phrase it:

Good morning, @Swapnil Helonde,

As we are returning Boolean values in our table for some metrics (e.g., initial_registration_failures_cc7-5gs_increase_services_not_allowed), we need to ensure consistency between our table and Grafana. Currently, Grafana is returning just the increase value with the greater-than condition (> 0), but to align with our table output, we should modify the Grafana expressions to return Boolean values as well.

To do this, we need to update the expressions to include the bool condition, as follows:

sum by(kubernetes_namespace) (increase(pcmn_VS_MM_RegInitRejCc7_5GS[1h])) > bool 0

Once confirmed, I can proceed with updating these expressions and regenerate the CSVs to ensure the output matches our expectations.

Let me know if this approach works for you.
