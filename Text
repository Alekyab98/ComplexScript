We got data from the launcher node for the eighth date, sixth hour, with one FQDN and all the AMF metric names. I used the same FQDN, timestamp, and metric names to get data from our Grafana table, using AMF as the function name to include all the AMF columns for comparison. However, the order of the metric names in Grafana was different from the launcher node, so I couldn’t compare them side by side. Instead, I put them in two separate sheets. You can compare them by looking for the metric names in both sheets.

From what I’ve seen, most of the values match with the new logic, but please check it once more to be sure. Let me know if you find anything that needs fixing.
