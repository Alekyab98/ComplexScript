In our recent analysis, we joined the new test table with our existing table and the Grafana data. The results show a 96% match with the old increase value for some metrics, but the match percentage for the new increase value is significantly lower. Additionally, some metrics do not align with either the old or new increase values. We are also seeing variations in the sum calculations between the Grafana values and our table.
